title: STDOUT formatters added to run configuration
---
You can now run features as run configurations that run to the terminal; and select from all STDOUT options (monochrome or ANSI)
ANSI works the best if you see ansi colours in the terminal, which can be achieved by adding a plugin such as http://mihai-nita.net/2013/06/03/eclipse-plugin-ansi-in-console/
